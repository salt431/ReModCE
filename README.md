Deprecation, this client base has been deprecated, a new client engine is in development!!, until its release this current client will be maintained and bugs fixed for the testers involved, expect an entirely new client within a month or so if development keeps at its current pace!!

EOL no future updates will occur in this branch as of 4/16/22

testers will receive the paid client release for free once its released, i will contact each of you via discord once this happens.

bug reporting will remain until 5/1/22 barring any changes in my life that would affect development currently struggling a bit in highschool lol

this new client will be based on *nocturnal* client but heavy modifications will be made to ensure it isnt just a paste, along with some work done in this branch carrying over. it was an amazing run getting this project worked on and it was a great learning experience getting into unity hacking!! (i initially came from source engine hacking in games such as csgo and apex). 

dont panic!!! a free version of the client will also be released with the essential feature set such as anti-crashers and everything base nocturnal prvoides along with a few features im working on, however payment will be required for the more advanced modules in progress.

this readme will be updated once this project is complete. in the meantime contact me on discord at netcat420#6708 if you have any bugs in this current client or if you wish to share this beta tester version with anyone else. after the close date 5/1/22 the test will officially close and anyone can use this client without the need to pm me

expected rebelmod release date (barring any changes) 7/4/22
